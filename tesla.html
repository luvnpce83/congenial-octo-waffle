        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Joshua, there are several financial incentive programs that can significantly reduce the cost of purchasing a used electric vehicle (EV), including a Tesla.
            By strategically combining these programs, it may be possible to bring the final price down to less than $10,000.
            Let's explore the available programs and why Tesla can be a particularly advantageous choice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold border-b-2 pb-2 mb-4">Key Incentive Programs</h2>

        <div class="mb-6">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Federal Used EV Tax Credit - Up to $4,000</h3>
            <p>
                The federal government offers a tax credit of <span class="highlight">up to $4,000</span> for qualifying used electric vehicles.
                The vehicle must be purchased from a dealer and typically needs to cost $25,000 or less.
                <span class="highlight">Starting January 1, 2024, eligible buyers can receive this credit as an upfront payment at the time of sale from a qualified dealer,
                which directly reduces the purchase price.</span> Income limitations for the buyer apply.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amount:</strong> Up to $4,000</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Purchased from a dealer, vehicle price $25,000 or less, specific model year criteria, buyer income limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Can be applied as an upfront discount at the point of sale by participating dealers.</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Southern California Edison (SCE) Pre-Owned EV Rebate - $1,000 or $4,000</h3>
            <p>
                If you are a Southern California Edison (SCE) customer, you may be eligible for a rebate when purchasing a pre-owned EV.
                The standard rebate is <span class="highlight">$1,000</span>. However, if you meet specific household income requirements, you could receive a higher rebate of <span class="highlight">$4,000</span> (Rebate Plus Option).
                Even if the SCE service account is in your father's name, you can still apply as an active residential customer, and your income qualifies for the higher rebate.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amount:</strong> $1,000 (Standard) or $4,000 (Income-Qualified Rebate Plus)</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> SCE residential customer, specific EV models. Service account does not have to be in applicant's name.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> A regional rebate for SCE customers.</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Driving Clean Assistance Program (DCAP) / Clean Cars 4 All - Up to $7,500+ (Purchase Only Available)</h3>
            <p>
                The Driving Clean Assistance Program (DCAP) provides incentives statewide in California.
                This program has two main pathways:
                <br><br>
                <strong>a) Clean Cars 4 All (Scrap and Replace):</strong> This is the traditional pathway, offering <span class="highlight">up to $12,000</span> (or more with charging incentives) for low-income Californians who retire an older, high-polluting vehicle and replace it with a new or used clean vehicle.
                <br><br>
                <strong>b) Financing Assistance (Purchase Only - No Scrap Required):</strong> Crucially, DCAP also provides a "Financing Assistance" option. For eligible low-income community members, this pathway can offer <span class="highlight">up to $7,500</span> to purchase or lease a new or used battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) <span class="highlight">without requiring you to scrap an old vehicle</span>. These funds can be provided as upfront grants paid directly to authorized dealerships, effectively acting as a down payment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amount:</strong> Up to $7,500 (Financing Assistance, no scrap required) or up to $12,000+ (Clean Cars 4 All, with scrap).</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Low-income California resident. For "Financing Assistance," no vehicle scrap is required, but must purchase from an authorized dealership.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Offers significant upfront financial assistance for clean vehicle purchases, even without retiring an old car.</li>

            <h3 class="2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Vehicle Retirement Program Rebate - $1,500 or $2,000 (If Applicable)</h3>
            <p>
                While you mentioned not having an eligible car to scrap for this program, it's worth noting for others that California's Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) Consumer Assistance Program (CAP) offers rebates for retiring older, polluting vehicles. This program can provide <span class="highlight">$1,500 or $2,000</span> (for low-income individuals) in assistance.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amount:</strong> $1,500 (standard) or $2,000 (low-income).</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Vehicle must meet specific criteria for age, registration, and emissions test failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> An additional way to receive funds when disposing of an older vehicle.</li>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold border-b-2 pb-2 mb-4">Why Tesla is Advantageous</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            When considering these various incentives, Tesla stands out for several reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Upfront Federal Used EV Credit Availability:</strong> Many dealerships are limited in their ability to provide the federal used EV tax credit as an upfront discount. However, Tesla is often a qualified seller that can facilitate this immediate deduction, significantly reducing your initial out-of-pocket expense.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Eligibility for DCAP (Financing Assistance):</strong> Since the Financing Assistance pathway of DCAP does not require scrapping a vehicle and provides upfront grants through authorized dealers, Tesla vehicles are well-positioned for this benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Streamlined Online Purchase Process:</strong> Tesla's website allows you to view their used vehicle inventory directly and order online without the typical back-and-forth with a traditional dealer. This makes the purchase process very convenient and transparent.
                You can often find <span class="highlight">used Model 3s with around 30,000 miles for under $25,000</span> on their official used inventory site.

        </ul>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Based on your eligibility for the income-qualified SCE rebate and the DCAP Financing Assistance (without scrap), here's how the potential final cost could be calculated, assuming a used Tesla priced under $25,000:
